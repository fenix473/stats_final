    <h2>Rationelle</h2>
    <p>This research explores the portrayal and public health impact of smoking in the U.S., situating the issue within the framework of social justice. Classical philosophy provides a foundational lens for this discussion. According to Plato, justice in a state is achieved when "each class (rulers, auxiliaries, producers) fulfills its role without interfering with the others." While adult tobacco use might seem like a private matter under this logic, the broader social consequences demand public concern. <br>

      Socrates further defines justice not as the pursuit of individual happiness, but as the harmonization of the community: <br>
      
      "The law is not concerned with the special happiness of any class in the state, but [...] harmonizing and adapting the citizens to one another by persuasion and compulsion [...] with a view to using them for the binding together of the Commonwealth.” (Socrates)<br>
      
      This insight is particularly relevant to the tobacco industry. It historically prioritized profit over communal welfare, often through manipulative marketing and misinformation. Especially egregious was the targeting of children—a class with limited autonomy and heightened vulnerability. Marketing tobacco to youth not only interferes with public health goals but sacrifices one generation’s future for another’s profit, violating intergenerational justice.<br>
      
      From a social justice standpoint, we confront a conflict between public health agencies and private industries. The latter have introduced avoidable harms into the societal fabric, disproportionately affecting marginalized and underprotected populations (e.g., low-income families, racial minorities, and youth). Children lack the informed agency that Plato attributes to adult producers in his ideal city; thus, enabling their exploitation by tobacco interests represents a civic failure.<br>
      
      Framing smoking through this philosophical and ethical lens highlights why it is not merely a personal health issue but a structural one. Just as the AI labor displacement issue raises concerns of reintegration and protection of vulnerable groups, smoking too becomes a mirror of society’s capacity—or incapacity—to safeguard its most at-risk citizens.<br>
      
      On a good note, we see a steady decline in smoking rates across the US population. Supposedly the massive anti-smoking campaigns worked efficiently. Tobacco industry received colossal backlash from society, which size can be compared only to their financial gains. However, even those campaigns were not shy of spreading false information or dramatisation. These anti-smoking campaigns face some criticism, especially in the ethicality of their means to achieve their goals. Inevitably with such a zealous effort in anti-smoking campaigns led to stigmatization of smokers. Which is a borderline social justice issue as well, how can we help people whom we reject to listen. <br>
      
      Today, we see a rapid increase in cigarette substitutes, promoted as safer options and capitalizing on those claims. Even if those claims are not always scientifically proven and are sometimes cases of mere speculation. Introduction of those substitutes, such as vapes and nicotine pouches; led to a legislative gap, resulting in lack of regulation on new markets. Legislative gap, big tobacco corporation sluggishness and lack of regulation introduced many small manufacturers to the market. Working with such dangerous substances as Nicotine and unregulated flavour additives, introduces even more potential danger in those products. <br>
      
      These new alternatives may also offer attractive flavours, produce less smoke and more discretion. This has proven to be especially appealing to young adults, resulting in a spike in smoking in schools. This is a disruptive issue, lacking intense distinct cigarette smoke smell or burning products recognised by smoke detectors, it becomes significantly harder for school staff to identify smokers. FDA reports as much as 8.1% of high school students report currently smoking. Which is a decline from year before, but it is reasonable to question the reliability of self-reporting data in high school students. Some sources, based on interviewing teachers, don't believe FDA rates, and suggest that actual rates are much higher.<br>
      
      The point was that the issue is alive, even if it appears to be less significant than before. We cannot answer all the questions from above, however, we can bring some attention in order to bring more awareness to the issue. This is why the topic of this research is study of the underrepresented group of smokers, which is social justice.<br>
