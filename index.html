  <section id="why-this-matters">
    <h2>1.1&2 Rationelle</h2>
    <p>This research explores the portrayal and public health impact of smoking in the U.S., situating the issue within the framework of social justice. Classical philosophy provides a foundational lens for this discussion. According to Plato, justice in a state is achieved when "each class (rulers, auxiliaries, producers) fulfills its role without interfering with the others." While adult tobacco use might seem like a private matter under this logic, the broader social consequences demand public concern. <br><br></p>

    <p>Socrates further defines justice not as the pursuit of individual happiness, but as the harmonization of the community: <br><br></p>
      
    <span class="quote">"The law is not concerned with the special happiness of any class in the state, but [...] harmonizing and adapting the citizens to one another by persuasion and compulsion [...] with a view to using them for the binding together of the Commonwealth.”(Socrates)</span><br><br>
      
    <p>This insight is particularly relevant to the tobacco industry. It historically prioritized profit over communal welfare, often through manipulative marketing and misinformation. Especially egregious was the targeting of children—a class with limited autonomy and heightened vulnerability. Marketing tobacco to youth not only interferes with public health goals but sacrifices one generation’s future for another’s profit, violating intergenerational justice.<br><br></p>
      
    <p>From a social justice standpoint, we confront a conflict between public health agencies and private industries. The latter have introduced avoidable harms into the societal fabric, disproportionately affecting marginalized and underprotected populations (e.g., low-income families, racial minorities, and youth). Children lack the informed agency that Plato attributes to adult producers in his ideal city; thus, enabling their exploitation by tobacco interests represents a civic failure.<br><br></p>
      
    <p>Framing smoking through this philosophical and ethical lens highlights why it is not merely a personal health issue but a structural one. Just as the AI labor displacement issue raises concerns of reintegration and protection of vulnerable groups, smoking too becomes a mirror of society’s capacity—or incapacity—to safeguard its most at-risk citizens.<br><br></p>
      
    <p>On a good note, we see a steady decline in smoking rates across the US population. Supposedly the massive anti-smoking campaigns worked efficiently. Tobacco industry received colossal backlash from society, which size can be compared only to their financial gains. However, even those campaigns were not shy of spreading false information or dramatisation. These anti-smoking campaigns face some criticism, especially in the ethicality of their means to achieve their goals. Inevitably with such a zealous effort in anti-smoking campaigns led to stigmatization of smokers. Which is a borderline social justice issue as well, how can we help people whom we reject to listen. <br><br></p>
      
    <p>Today, we see a rapid increase in cigarette substitutes, promoted as safer options and capitalizing on those claims. Even if those claims are not always scientifically proven and are sometimes cases of mere speculation. Introduction of those substitutes, such as vapes and nicotine pouches; led to a legislative gap, resulting in lack of regulation on new markets. Legislative gap, big tobacco corporation sluggishness and lack of regulation introduced many small manufacturers to the market. Working with such dangerous substances as Nicotine and unregulated flavour additives, introduces even more potential danger in those products. <br><br></p>
      
    <p>These new alternatives may also offer attractive flavours, produce less smoke and more discretion. This has proven to be especially appealing to young adults, resulting in a spike in smoking in schools. This is a disruptive issue, lacking intense distinct cigarette smoke smell or burning products recognised by smoke detectors, it becomes significantly harder for school staff to identify smokers. FDA reports as much as 8.1% of high school students report currently smoking. Which is a decline from year before, but it is reasonable to question the reliability of self-reporting data in high school students. Some sources, based on interviewing teachers, don't believe FDA rates, and suggest that actual rates are much higher.<br><br></p>
      
    <p>The point was that the issue is alive, even if it appears to be less significant than before. We cannot answer all the questions from above, however, we can bring some attention in order to bring more awareness to the issue. This is why the topic of this research is study of the underrepresented group of smokers, which is social justice.<br><br></p>

  <section id="research-question">
    <h2>1.3 Research Question</h2>
    <p>Given the volume of the issue, we can only answer some questions. During our research, we’ve encountered a lack of publicly available estimation of the population of smokers. This is a very high-level and important metric. We will simply use our data to compare proportions of smokers to non-smokers. Additionally, we will test whether 2023 continued the old trend of decline in smoking rates from 2022.</p>
    <p>Another high-level metric we can use is overall clinical image of a smoker, this is a mere description of major risks involved in smoking using chi square. The purpose is to have an image of the health consequences.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we tackle some popular beliefs. We’ve heard people saying something like “ I work 14 hours at the mill and need to relax [with a cigarette]”. Implying that smoking is a psychological relief. Smokers are supposed to have a better happiness score based on this claim.</p>
    <p>Another popular belief is encapsulated in “It will give me cancer at 80, I don’t care, who wants to live to 90”. Based on our clinical image, smokers associated health issues should not prevail by the age of 80. We give some discount to this extreme opinion and will test whether smoking associated issues manifest before the age of 60.</p>
    <p>To put it into the list: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Population of smokers in 2023.(1.1)<ul><li>Does it decline?(1.2)</ul></li>
      <li>Clinical Image of the smokers.(2.1)<ul><li>Do health related issues manifest before the age of 60 or not?(2.2)</ul></li>
      <li>Do smokers have a higher level of life satisfaction compared to non-smokers?(3)</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="data-sources">
    <h2>2.1 Data Sources</h2>
    <p>We are using National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data designed by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) conducted in 2023. In this study we use only adult population survey data as well as only public access variables. This is our only source of data for conduction of our statistics.</p>
    <p>Dataset consists of 25000 (n=25000) samples with more than 400 variables. It is hard to estimate how many variables we have precisely, as some of them are computed based on other variables. Also, we cannot estimate exactly what variables are behind restrictions and we don’t have access to them. Dataset overview shows 600 variables, with most of them being unique and real, we will use only X of them in our study. More about this in methodology.</p>
    <p>The raw data and metadata can be found on CDC website at 2023 NHIS webpage. As well as handbooks with more details on data collection, variables identification and other supplemental material. We will be using subsets of data, all data manipulations will be covered in methodology and are readily available in supplement1.RMd on google drive.</p>

  <section id="study-type">
    <h2>2.2 Type of Study</h2>
    <p>This is a cross-sectional, observational statistical analysis that combines descriptive and inferential methods. We compare proportions, build confidence intervals, use hypothesis testing and chi square. Its goal is to produce a general overview of the issue and highlight some of the problems in the smoking population domain. The study aims to inform public awareness campaigns and spark critical conversations around smoking-related health perceptions and behaviors.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="bias">
    <h2>2.3 Bias</h2>
    <p>We will encounter a lot of bias in this study. Giving the broadness of research it is challenging to account for all the bias. We will not segment our data deeply, but we account for it in terms of recognising inaccuracy of our results that are likely to diverge from the real population. For example we count as smokers all people who smoked at least 100 cigarettes. Meaning that we blend heavy smokers and people who smoked 101 cigarettes 40 years ago together, directly impacting accuracy of our smoking health related issues analysis.</p>
    <p>Another source of bias is for example life-satisfaction level, which is hard to measure and thus we must be at least somewhat sceptical in any results regarding this topic. And of course surveys themselves inherently are prone to bias, because they rely a lot on personal self-assessment. As mentioned before, smokers themselves are stigmatised and so this should reflect on data in the ways we cannot account for.</p>
    <p>Author's personal bias comes from the fact that I am directly impacted by the issue, being an active smoker may impact my interpretation. However, it is also a driver of this research. Recognising my bias, this is why I decided to do this research in the first place, an attempt for critical analysis of issues I face and millions of others like me.</p>

  <section id="lurking-variables">
    <h2>2.4 Lurking Variables</h2>
    <p>The most important confounding variable is to recognise the arbitrary relationship of smoking to all of the other variables. It requires separate study for each and every variable to test whether smoking is associated with the studied variable x. For example it requires a separate study to figure out if smoking affects happiness, or people smoke because of happiness. These issues are way beyond our scope, that's why we don’t make any claims in regards to this.</p>
    <p>Smoking has proven to be a direct cause of only a few issues, most of them are dependent on many other factors such as environment, wealth and social status. Any claims must acknowledge that even if some association exists, smoking may or may not be the biggest factor. For each variable explored (e.g., life satisfaction, presence of health issues), there may be multiple overlapping influences, many of which are outside the scope of this study.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="Analysis1">
    <h2>3.1 Population Overview</h2>
    <p>Many official sources claim that smoking rates have been decreasing for decades in the US. CDC official estimate is 11.6% by the year of 2022. This number comes from the count of cigarette smoking now (CIGNOW_A) and if a person ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes (SMKEV_A). CDC’s estimate doesn't account for the e-cigarette smoking population in their estimate, lowering the overall population of nicotine based products consumers. Their survey includes ECIGNOW_A.</p>
    <p>CIGNOW_A is a categorical variable, where surveyed answers question how often they smoke: (1) daily, (2) some day, (3) not at all, (7) refused, (9) don’t know. We filter as smokers people who answered 1 or 2.</p>
    <p>SMKEV_A is another categorical variable, answering the question “Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your ENTIRE LIFE?” with options: (1) Yes, (2) No. CDC in their estimate uses this variable, but we do not. We doubt there is a significant factor compared to smoking daily or some day from CIGNOW_A.</p>
    <p>ECIGNOW_A is similar to CIGNOW_A asking how often a surveyed person smokes electronic cigarettes: (1) daily, (2) some day, (3) not at all, (7) refused, (9) don’t know. We filter as combined smokers people who answered 1 or 2. We are avoiding overlap as each sample must qualify only for one condition to be included.</p>
